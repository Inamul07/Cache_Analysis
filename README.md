# Cache Analysis

### In this Repository
- Least Recently Used (LRU)
- Clock Page Replacement
- 2Q
- Adaptive Replacement Cache (ARC)

### Objectives
- This repository aims to analyse different page replacement algorithms.
- This repository contains implementations of the said page replacement algorithms, created in accordance with the relevant research papers.

### How to use this project
- Clone this Repository.
  ```bash
  $ git clone git@github.com:Inamul07/Cache_Analysis.git
  $ cd Cache_Analysis
  ```
- Edit the `main.c` file to include the required replacement algorithm.
- Then run this command in terminal,
  ```
  $ make
  ```

### Algorithm Methods
  
  | Algorithm | cache_name |
  |----|----|
  | Least Recently Used | lru |
  | Clock Page Replacement | clock |
  | Two Queue | two_queue |
  | Adaptive Replacement Cache | arc|

  #### Methods
  - `cache_init(char cache_name[], int capacity)`
    - Initializes the respective cache with given capacity.
    - returns `generic_cache*`.
  - `cache_access(generic_cache* cache, int page)`
    - Performs the relevant cache operation.
    - Keeps an internal count of number of hits and misses.
    - returns `void`.
  - `cache_analysis(generic_cache* cache)`
    - Prints the buffer, total references, number of hits and misses and hit ratio.
    - returns `void`.
  - `cache_print_buffer(generic_cache* cache)`
    - Prints the buffer at that current state.
    - returns `void`.
  - `cache_put_array(generic_cache* cache, int pages[], int size)`
    - Performs the relevant cache operation for each data item from `pages` in a linear fashion.
    - returns `void`.
  - `cache_destroy(generic_cache* cache)`
    - free the memory allocated by the `cache`.
    - returns `void`.
  > For Cache Initialisation, Pass the appropriate `cache_name` to the `cache_init()` method. ( Refer Table for appropriate `cache_name` ) <br />
  > Example: For Initialising LRU with a capacity of 3, `cache_init("lru", 3);`

### Benchmarking
- The `data` folder, at the root, contains test data generated by [Online Data Generator](https://www.onlinedatagenerator.com/manage/usertables/create/).
- We use [Google benchmark](https://github.com/google/benchmark/tree/main) to benchmark the Cache Replacement Algorithms.
- To run bench mark, execute the following command
  ```bash
  $ make benchmark
  ```
- This prints the time taken by the cache algorithms along with their respective `Hit Percentage`.
